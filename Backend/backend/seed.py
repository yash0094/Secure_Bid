"""
Synthetic data generator.

The real product would ingest CPPP/GeM/state-portal feeds. For a runnable
demo we generate a corpus that is statistically realistic enough that the
pricing engine, the eligibility parser and the collusion screens all have
something true to say:

  * ~200 live tenders with genuine-looking eligibility clause text
  * ~900 historical awards with the full bid table, three years deep
  * bid ratios drawn per (buyer x category) with their own mean and dispersion,
    so different buckets really do behave differently
  * one bucket seeded with a cover-bidding pattern, so the cartel screens have
    a true positive to find and are not just decoration
  * thin buckets left thin, so the shrinkage and the low-confidence warnings
    are exercised rather than hidden

Everything is seeded from a fixed RNG: two people running this get the same
numbers, which matters when you are demoing.
